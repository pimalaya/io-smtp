//! Stub I/O stream for driving SMTP coroutines against pre-crafted
//! response buffers.
//!
//! [`StubStream`] implements [`Read`] + [`Write`] on top of an
//! in-memory cursor. Pair it with [`handle`] (re-exported from
//! [`io_socket::runtimes::std_stream`]) to drive any coroutine
//! without a network connection.
//!
//! Reads drain bytes from the response buffer provided at
//! construction; writes are silently discarded (the serialized
//! command is not asserted here).
